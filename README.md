# Death, life expectancy, and associated statistics from the United States of America according to the CDC
This is the README file for PARODI_Final_project_235.ipynb

This project uses data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/mortality involving 
multiple features of importance relating to the deaths of Americans through the years of 2005-2015. The original dataset was too large to run in an adequate amount of time so I took a random sample of 100,000 entries per year. This resulted in a total of 1,100,00 total samples once the datasets were combined. I cut down on the amount of columns, specifically the ones made up of more than 30% nan values. This resulted in 34 columns


The Project was divided into three points of interest: 
Education level
Marital Status
Dates and years

Each one of those points of interest was focused on the life expectancy and most common causes of death associated with each feature and subfuture. 

(I was unable to upload the data table because it was too large for the repository to accept)
